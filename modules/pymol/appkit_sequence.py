"""Sequence-viewer data query for the native SwiftUI app.

Emits one residue row per enabled molecular object (one guide atom per residue,
carrying its color index) for the SwiftUI SequencePanel. Mirrors the
appkit_inspector / appkit_object_panel bundled-module pattern.

Alignment behavior (BIMO-style): an alignment object never appears as its own
row (it has no guide atoms, so it is naturally skipped). When an alignment
object is *enabled*, its member objects are re-laid-out with gap cells inserted
so that aligned residues share a column across the stacked rows. When the
alignment is disabled, members display normally with no gaps.

Writes the JSON to a temp file (same TMPDIR the Swift app reads) and the caller
prints the short `SEQPANEL:ready` marker — the payload can exceed PyMOL's ~1KB
feedback-line cap.
